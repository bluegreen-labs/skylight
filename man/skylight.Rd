\title{Get sky illuminance parameters}
\usage{
skylight(longitude, latitude, date, sky_condition = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{longitude}{decimal longitude (single value or vector of values)}

\item{latitude}{decimal latitude (single value or vector of values)}

\item{date}{date and time in POSIXct format with GMT/UTC as time zone
(single value or vector of values)}

\item{sky_condition}{a positive value (>=1) with which to scale
illuminance values (1 = cloud cover < 70%, 2 = thin veiled clouds
3 = average clouds, 10 = dark stratus clouds). By and large this
can be considered a scaling factor, substiting it with the (inverse)
slope parameter of an empirical fit should render more accurate results.
(single value or vector of values)}

\description{
Function returns sky illuminance parameters for
both the sun and the moon, in addition to some
ancillary parameters such as sun and moon azimuth
and altitude.
}
\details{
The code is almost verbatim transcription of the work
"Computer Programs for Sun and Moon Illuminance
With Contingent Tables and Diagrams by Janiczek and DeYoung"
and published in the US Naval observatory circular nr. 171, 1987.

Required parameters are a location (in longitude, latitude),
and a date in POSIXct format set to the GMT/UTC time zone.
Conversions to GMT/UTC should be done externally, but errors
are trapped.

The original code has been vectorized, as such vectors of
location, time and/or sky conditions can be provided.

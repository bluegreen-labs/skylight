Description: This package is a simple sky illuminance model which calculates 
 illuminance values (in lux) for both sun and moon. The model is a verbatim 
 translation of the code included in: Computer Programs for Sun and Moon 
 Illuminance With Contingent Tables and Diagrams by Janiczek and DeYoung (1987,
